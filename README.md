# A-B-Testing-for-ENIAC  
We get to run X2 test to see which web design is more appealing to make an actual purchase. ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“‰

## How it's looking
Our favorite, but also imaginary, company ENIAC would like to know which of the FOUR web designs is the most effective 
when costumers and shopping are linked! ðŸ‘€ ðŸ’°

The company will like to know which variation is getting more clicks and so convertions! âœ… 

## Checking our data 
After giving a look to our tables, we can calculate or CTR (clik through rate), compare it and choose a winner :trophy:! 


or maybe two :trophy: :trophy:!? ðŸ˜¬
